            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>Hello, my name is Francisco Rodriguez. I am a 9 year Air Force veteran who decided to leave the military to pursue my passion of Neuroscience and Psychology. I learned that I have a passion for these two subjects while deployed. Reading about the brain on my off time helped me get through my deployments and I finally decided to gain new insight of my mind. I have also found a new passion along the way, coding! Creating and building things from nothing has put me at a loss for words because I can't even explain the joy it gives me. It feels extremely powerful to have this skill and I'm excited to learn more.</p>
